- **Continued hacking on the cloud - next 3 months**. You will continue to have access to the 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS for three months following the Cloud Hackathon so you can continue to work and we all learn more about what is involved with migrating data access and science workflows to the Cloud. This cloud compute environment is supported by the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project. 
- **Upcoming events - all virtual**
  - **[AGU Fall Meeting Workshop](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/124026)** - December 12 2021. The DAAC mentors will hold a short, half-day, virtual workshop at AGU on Sunday, Dec 12.
